b) x, y => x * y //missing () around parameter, error 

c) x => { x * 2 } //missing return

d) (x, z) => {console.log(z); return x * z} //all good, z would be logged then product of x * z returned 

e) x => console.log(z); return x * z // error, z is not defined, return needs {}

f) (x) => x * 2 //all good, product of x * 2
